tidyverse is a collection of open source packages for the R programming language introduced by Hadley Wickham and his team that "share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures" of tidy data.

data wrangling: clean data, reorganize data, uniform data
pipe: %>%
loop: many files needs to undertake the same thing, then use a loop
